It is regarded as a classic from the golden age of video arcade games, noted for its novel gameplay and theme. [wiki/Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger)\r\n\r\n#### Objectives of the game :running:\r\nThe object of the game is simple, you must direct the hero character across the grey brick road, full of enemy bugs, towards the water without getting hit.\r\n\r\nYour score is based on your current score + (level x 2) for each level you pass.\r\n\r\nThe enemy bugs run across the screen at random speeds in the x direction and random y locations given their constraints which is between the grey bricks.\r\n\r\nThe number of enemy bugs will increase by 1 until level 6 where an increase of 1 bug will be added to the total enemies each time you complete the level.\r\n\r\nIf you run into an enemy bug, you will reset, your level decreases by 1, your score decreases by 1 and the enemy you run into will disappear.\r\n\r\n![frogger image](/images/froggerwill.png)\r\n\r\n#### How to play and the controls :video_game:\r\nUsers control the hero character by using the main keyboard keys: [  ←   →   ↑   ↓  ] arrow keys on their keyboard.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.\r\n\r\nFor detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).",
