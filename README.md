#### Objectives of the game
The object of the game is simple, you must direct the hero character across the grey brick road, full of enemy bugs, towards the water without getting hit.

Your score is based on your current score + (level x 2) for each level you pass.

The enemy bugs run across the screen at random speeds in the x direction and random y locations given their contraints which is between the grey bricks.

The number of enemy bugs will incease by 1 until level 6 where an increase of 1 bug will be added to the total enemies each time you complete the level.

If you run into an enemy bug, you will reset, your level decreases by 1, your score decreases by 1 and the enemy you run into will disappear. Your enemy 'Bob' & 'Billy' are currently invincible, that will be changed in the next update of the game.

#### How to play and the controls
Users control the hero character by using the main keyboard keys: [←  →  ↑  ↓] arrow keys on their keyboard. There is no press down and hold option, you must press each key to move in that specific direction.
